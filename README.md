# iinact-tui

A rust-based, dependency‑light DPS meter for FFXIV based entirely in the terminal that connects to the IINACT Plugin and renders a kagerou‑style table using ratatui.

## Features
- Show live combat data directly in your terminal
- Swap between DPS and Heal modes
- Saves encounters in a sorted history list ...
- ... and displays them in a dedicated window!
- Swap between DPS and Heal view in history.
- Change the visual decorations with a simple hotkey (more to come...)
- Decorations currently implemented (cycle with `d`):
  - `Decor: underline` — thin role-colored bar directly under each entry (two-line rows).
  - `Decor: background` — role-colored background meter behind each entry (one-line rows).
  - `Decor: none` — no extra decoration (compact one-line rows).
- Simple settings management through .config file and/or TUI
- Configurable 'Idle Mode' (more to come...)

## Prerequisites
- Rust 1.74+ (stable) recommended if you're building from source
- IINACT running locally (or reachable over your network)
  - Default WebSocket endpoint: `ws://127.0.0.1:10501/ws`

## Build from source & Run
```bash
# From the repo root
cargo run
# Write logs to the default config directory (~/.config/iinact-tui/debug.log)
cargo run -- --debug
# Or choose a custom log file path
cargo run -- --debug ./logs/iinact-debug.log
```
The app will connect automatically to `ws://127.0.0.1:10501/ws` and begin rendering as soon as events arrive.

### Debug logging
- Pass `--debug` to enable file logging at startup. Without it, the TUI stays silent (no stdout/stderr noise).
- Supplying `--debug` with no value writes all tracing output (info/debug/warn/error) to `~/.config/iinact-tui/debug.log` on Unix-like systems or the equivalent config directory on Windows.
- Provide a path after `--debug` (e.g., `--debug ./logs/iinact.log`) to log elsewhere; parent directories are created automatically if needed.

## Controls
- `q` or `Esc` — quit
- `d` — cycle decorations (underline → background → none)
- `m` — toggle table mode (DPS ↔ HEAL)
- `s` — toggle the settings pane
- `h` — open/close the encounter history panel
- `i` — when idle mode is active, toggle the idle overlay on/off to peek at the last encounter
- `↑/↓` — move the selection inside the settings pane
- `←/→` — adjust the selected setting (idle timeout, default decoration, default mode)

## Technical Notes & Behavior
- Party‑only: rows are filtered to common job codes (PLD/WAR/DRK/GNB, WHM/SCH/AST/SGE, MNK/DRG/NIN/SAM/RPR/VPR, BRD/MCH/DNC, BLM/SMN/RDM/PCT, BLU).
- Normalization: numeric fields arrive as strings; commas/percent signs are stripped before parsing for sorting/ratios. Damage share is computed from per‑combatant damage over encounter total.
- Encounter naming: while a fight is active some servers report generic names (e.g., "Encounter"); the header falls back to Zone until a final name is available.
- Background: widgets avoid setting a background color so your terminal theme (blur/transparency) stays visible. The header separator uses a subtle gray; background meters intentionally set a background for the meter fill only.
- Persisted config: settings are written to `~/.config/iinact-tui/iinact-tui.config` on Linux/macOS (or `%APPDATA%\iinact-tui\iinact-tui.config` on Windows). Set `IINACT_TUI_CONFIG_DIR` to override.
- History panel: press `h` to switch into the history view; use `↑/↓` or mouse scroll to pick a date, hit `Enter`/click to drill into the encounters list, press `Enter` again for per-encounter details, and `←`/`Backspace` to step back. Date and encounter lists load from lightweight indexes first, with overlay indicators while data hydrates; encounter detail fetches the full frame-by-frame record on demand.
- Idle overlay: when the app is idle you’ll see the idle window by default—press `i` to hide/show it without leaving idle mode so you can review the most recent encounter quickly.

## Troubleshooting
- Confirm IINACT is running and the endpoint is reachable. The default is `ws://127.0.0.1:10501/ws`.
- History or live table is empty? Only party and combat jobs are shown; pets/limit break lines are filtered out. (for now)

## Roadmap (short)
- "Dungeon Mode" to merge Encounters in the history for the same dungeon.
- "Dungeon View" to view historical dungeon runs with more information.
- Dedicated Limit Break window (who/when/how much/what level)
- Theme presets (purple/cyberpunk, monochrome, gray meters).
- Toggle for background opacity
- Persist meter mode and layout preference.
